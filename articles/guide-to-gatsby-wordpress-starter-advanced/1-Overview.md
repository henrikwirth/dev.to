## Who is this tutorial for? ðŸ‘¥

For people who want to get started with Gatsby in combination with WordPress and create a production ready client-site or personal sites with lots of nice features. You should have a basic understanding of WordPress and JavaScript. The tutorial will get more advanced and into edge-cases, the further you go.

Feel free to use the comments if something doesn't make sense to you. I'll try my best to help out for any level of experience.

## Requirements used for the project ðŸ“‹

- CMS
  - Highly Customizable
  - Easy to use
- Secure
- Translatable (Multi-Language)
- Low Frequency Updates
- Responsive Design
- Good performance (SEO and site speed)
- Scale: ~100 Pages

So in short: **A modern extensible multi-language site**.

## What will you learn? ðŸŽ“

Obviously this **depends on your knowledge**. The first parts (1-3) of the tutorial, will be more basic things, while from the middle onwards it will get more advanced, more specific to use cases and more edge-case.

I just worked on a client project, that had all the above requirements and there is not many tutorials out there, which in depth, explain how to implement a full-fledged production ready site with i18n, previews and the ability to have some sort of page builder ability.

**You will learn about:**

- The basic setup and deployment.
- How to make use of ACF flexible content field
  - How to dynamically render your components depending on which components are in use.
- How WPGraphQl works and how you can extend it to your needs.
- How to implement your multi-language setup with Polylang.
- How you get Previews to work with dynamic data. Without the need of rebuilds.
